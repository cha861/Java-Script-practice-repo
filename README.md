# 🚀 JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository is a collection of my practice, notes, and small code snippets as I learn **JavaScript** step by step.  
I’ll be updating this repo regularly with new concepts, examples, and mini projects.  

## 📌 Topics Covered So Far  

- ✅ Installed **Node.js** (to run JS outside the browser)  
- ✅ Variables and Constants (`let`, `const`, `var`)  
- ✅ JavaScript History & Evolution  
- ✅ Data Types (Primitive & Reference types)  
- ✅ Type Conversion & Type Coercion  
- ✅ Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment, etc.)  
- ✅ Switch Statement  
- ✅ Template Literals  
- ✅ Loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)

## 📂 Structure of the Repo  

- Each topic will have its own folder or `.js` file with practice examples.  
- I’ll also add notes or markdown files for quick reference.

## 🎯 Next Steps  

- Functions (declaration, expression, arrow functions)  
- Arrays & Objects  
- DOM Manipulation  
- Events in JavaScript  
- Mini Projects  

## 🤝 Contributions  

This repo is mainly for my personal practice, but suggestions, issues, and improvements are always welcome.
